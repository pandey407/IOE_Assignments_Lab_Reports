    \section{Required Tools}
    \subsection{Cisco Packet Tracer}
    Cisco Packet Tracer is a visual simulation software developed and distributed by Cisco Systems. Packet Tracer is a cross platform tool that allows simulated environment for modern computer network and network topologies. 
    \section{Simulation Activities}
    The networks shown in Figure~\ref{fig:activitya}, \ref{fig:activityb} and \ref{fig:activityc} were created using packet tracer for the activities in the lab experiment. For sanity, the ping tests to and from group A (PC0, PC1 and PC2), group B (PC3, PC4 and PC5), and group C (PC6, PC7 and PC8) are represented by ping tests to and from PC0, PC3 and PC6 respectively. The observations for all the tests were conducted but only the selected ones are included in the report. The PCs are selected such that the observations represent the overall requirement of the activities.

    \section{Exercises}
    \problem{What is a subnet mask? Why is it used? Explain with examples.}
    A subnet mask is a four-octet or 32-bit number that is used in networks to identify the network and host IDs of a 32-bit IP address. The subnet mask is used to mask certain bits in the IP address using bitwise ANDing to determine the network and host IDs.

\label{tbl:classidentifier}
  \end{table}
  While the default subnet masks shown in Table~\ref{tbl:subnetmasks} are used in identifying the network and host IDs as in Table~\ref{tbl:classidentifier}, the usage of subnet mask isn't limited to that. Subnet masks are used to segment larger networks into subnetworking by a process called subnetting. The default mask allows for over 16 million hosts per network for class A, over 16 thousand for class B and 254 for class C. But these numbers are useless since physical networks aren't located on a single network segment. The use of custom subnet masks allow the network to be split up into multiple unique routable networks. For instance, by changing the subnet mask from 255.255.0.0 to 255.255.255.0, we have 254 unique networks that each support 254 hosts.

\caption{Subnetting using custom subnet mask}
\label{tbl:subnetting}
\end{table}
Another example of a subnet mask's usage illustrated in Table~\ref{tbl:subnetting}can be figured out by taking two addresses, 200.200.20.2 and 200.200.20.34. For a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, both of these IPs are on the same network, 200.200.20.0. But if we change the subnet mask to 255.255.255.224, the IP 200.200.20.2 is on the network 200.200.20.0 and IP 200.200.20.34 is on the network 200.200.20.32.
    \problem{How does a sending host know whether the destination computer is on the same network or on the
    different network? How data packet is forwarded in each case from the sending host? Explain.}
    A sending host looking to communicate with a destination uses the subnet mask to determine whether the destination is in the same subnet as itself or in a different one. The bitwise ANDing of the IP address of the host and the subnet mask gives the network ID for the host. Similarly, the bitwise AND operation between the destination IP address and subnet mask identifies the network the destination is in. This is all performed by the sending host, based on which two of the following cases are possible,
    \subsubsection*{Host and destination in same subnet}
    If the destination is in the same subnet, i.e. is local to the host, the host uses the arp table to lookup the MAC address of the destination and directly communicates with the destination. 
    \subsubsection*{Host and destination in different subnet}
    If the destination is in a different subnet, i.e. is rempte to the host, the host forwards the packet to the default gateway which then uses the route tables to communicate with the destination.

    \problem{What is a routing? Explain static routing and configuration of static routing in a router with its
    syntax and functions. Also mention how the routing table of a router can be observed.}
    Routing is a process of determining the best way for a packet to move from one network to another. It is a process used by a router to route packets based on the packet header and routing table.\\
    A router makes routing decisions based on which the packets are forwarded to the remote network. Static routing is one such method for routing. It is a technique where the network administrator adds non-adaptive routes manually into the routing table. The routes aren't to be modified or changed by the router based on network status. The use of static routing technique is useful for networks that require control over the routes that a packet takes, which ensures security during communication. The routes are manually added on the routing table using the syntax enlisted in Listing~\ref{lst:syntaxrouting}.
    \lstinputlisting[label={lst:syntaxrouting},caption={Syntax for configuring static route}, captionpos=b]{./Outputs/syntaxrouting.txt}
    The routing table of a router can be observed using the command 
    \textit{show ip route}.

This is beacuse the sending host, at first couldn't locate PC3 in it's subnet but didn't know where to forward the packet. But once the default gateway is set correctly such that the router can receive the packet in case the sending host doesn't locate the destination itself, the router routes the packets correctly to other subnet. The default gateways for the two subnets are the IP addresses of the interfaces of the router that the switches are connected to. \pagebreak

  The ping request from PC3 to PC4 is successful and PC3 to PC0 failed with request timed out error for sub activity 3, but when the default gateway for PC0, PC1 and PC2 is set to 200.200.20.1 and that for PC3, PC4 and PC5 is set to 200.200.20.33, the ping request from PC3 (200.200.20.34) to PC0 (200.200.20.2) succeeds whereas the ping to PC4 remains unchanged. This is beacuse the sending host, at first couldn't locate PC0 in it's subnet but didn't know where to forward the packet. But once the default gateway is set correctly such that the router can receive the packet in case the sending host doesn't locate the destination itself, the router routes the packets correctly to other subnet.

    \cmdop{b_showip}{show ip route on Router0}
    Listing~\ref{lst:b_showip} shows the results for running the show ip route command on Router0. There are two interfaces connected in the network that are denoted by L (Local). Also, C (Connected) status indicates that the route was learned as a result of configuring the interface, which means that the two subnets connected on the two gigabitethernet interfaces are shown. There is no static route available as we haven't set one yet.

  The syntax to configure a static ip route is enlisted in Listing~\ref{lst:syntaxrouting}. For the network 3, the subnet mask is 255.255.255.224 and the next-hop-address is 200.200.20.66, but the destination network address needs to be calculated. To calculate the network address for network 3, we can perform bitwise AND operation between the subnet mask for the network and an IP address from the network, i.e. IP address of any of PC6, PC7 or PC8.

      The ping tests that previously failed are now successful since the static route has been setup for inter-network communication. The network 1 and 2 can communicate with the default gateway properly set whereas the network 3 requires a proper static route to be accessible from network 1 and network 2 and vice versa. 
      \section{Conclusion}
       The activities were performed sequentially which aided in the understanding of a network subnetting and the various steps that need to be followed to configure a proper network topology. While performing activity A, the concepts of subnet masks and subnetting were understood once the change in the default subnet mask was made. The change divided the network into two subnets which resulted in the ping tests from one subnet to the other to fail. During activity B, the inital observations were quite similar to that of the latter half of activity A since the packets weren't leaving a subnet although we had a router configured. Once the proper default gateways (IP address of the interface connected to the subnet) for all the PCs in both the subnets were set, the two subnets could communicate with each other as seen in the observations. For activity C, two routers were connected and different ping tests were performed. The additional subnetwork 3 couldn't communicate with the existing networks 1 and 2. The ip route table for both the routers showed that the router had no idea of the route that it should forward the packets to, and this is true since the static route wasn't set till this point. This is where the two ways a data packet is sent from a sending host to a destination was observed. Since the host couldn't find the destination on it's subnet, it forwarded the packet to the default gateway, which should've routed the packets to the destination but couldn't since the route wasn't defined. Once the static routes for both the routers were set properly, all the ping tests succeeded. Hence, the completion of this lab experiment allowed us to observe and understand the concepts of subnet masks, default gateway and static routing along with their usage within a network.
