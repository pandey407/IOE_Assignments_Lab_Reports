\section{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Familiarization with design of IIR digital filters from analog filter.
	\item Comparison of response for different filter approximations like butterworth, chebyshev I, chebyshev II and elliptic filters.
\end{itemize}
\section{Background Theory}
There are several methods that can be used to design digital filters having an infinite duration unit sample response. One of the popular methods is based on converting an analog filter into a digital filter. In this method we begin the design of digital filter in the analog domain and then convert the design into the digital domain. For this purpose, depending on the specifications of the required digital filter the various approximations like butterworth, chebyshev I, chebyshev II and elliptic filters are used.\\
Among the different approaches used in the design of digital IIR filters this lab experiment deals with impulse invariance method and bi-linear transformation.
\subsection{Impulse Invariance Method}
In impulse invariance method, the objective is to design an IIR filter having an unit sample response $h[n]$ that is the sampled version of the impulse response of the analog filter.
\begin{equation*}
    h[n]=h[nT] \quad \quad n=0,1,2,\dots\dots, \text{where } T\text{ is the sampling interval}
\end{equation*}
\subsection{Bi-Linear Transformation}
In bi-linear transformation a conformal mapping from s-plane to z-plane is carried out with the relation given as,
\begin{equation*}
    s=\frac{2}{T}\left(\frac{1-z^{-1}}{1+z^{-1}}\right)
\end{equation*}

\mysubsub{Comparison between the two methods}
From the observations in Figure~\ref{fig:5_1_a} and Figure~\ref{fig:5_1_b} it is visible that the converted digital filter has somewhat of a similar magnitude response when compared with analog filter. However, the digital filter undergoes spectrum aliasing. This is due to the fact that s-plane to z-plane mapping is many-to-one, i.e., all poles in s-plane between $\left[\ddfrac{(2k-1)\pi}{T},\ddfrac{(2k+1)\pi}{T}\right]$ where $k=0,1,2,\dots\dots$ map into the entire z-plane, which leads to infinite number of poles mapped onto the same location thus producing aliasing effect. Due to this fact the impulse invariance method is not preferred while designing IIR filter other than lowpass nature. When the sampling time $(T)$ is increased it generally results in a frequency response that is more spaces out hence decreasing the chances of aliasing. However, this is not the case with impulse invariance method. Hence the increase in sampling time has no effect on the reduction of aliasing that happens. \\
Similarly, from the observations in Figure~\ref{fig:5_1_e} and Figure~\ref{fig:5_1_f}, there is no visible aliasing effect. This is due to the fact that s-plane to z-plane mapping is one-to-one. Due to this fact the bilinear transformation has no restriction on the type of filter that can be transformed. The only known disadvantage of the bilinear transformation is the frequency warping, which is the effect where there exists a non-linear relationship between the continuous time filter frequency and discrete time filter frequency. To compensate for this phenomena, a technique called pre-warping is applied.
\mysub{Design of IIR digital lowpass filter for given specifications}
\problem{An IIR digital low pass filter is required to meet the following specifications:}
\begin{alltt}
    Pass band ripple (or peak to peak ripple):\ensuremath{\leq} 0.5 dB
    Pass band edge: 1.2 kHz

    \label{fig:5_2_butter}
\end{figure}
From the observations in Figure~\ref{fig:5_2_butter}, the nature of the filter is lowpass. There is no ripple in the passband or the stopband of the filter, i.e. it is maximally flat. The cut-off frequency is 0.34 ($\times \pi$ rad/sample), which coincides with the plot at $-3$ dB. The order of the filter is 9.

\mysubsub{Chebyshev I approximation}

    \caption{Plot for frequency response of chebyshev I filter}
    \label{fig:5_2_cheby1}
\end{figure}
From the observations in Figure~\ref{fig:5_2_cheby1}, the nature of the filter is lowpass. There is visible ripple in the passband but no ripple is seen in the stopband of the filter. The passband ripple is $\leq0.5$ dB. The cut-off frequency is 0.30 ($\times \pi$ rad/sample), which is actually the passband edge in normalized form. The order of the filter is 5.

    \caption{Plot for frequency response of chebyshev II filter}

\end{figure}
From the observations in Figure~\ref{fig:5_2_cheby2}, the nature of the filter is lowpass. There is visible ripple in the stopband but no ripple is seen in the passband of the filter. The stopband attenuation is $\geq40$ dB. The cut-off frequency is 0.50 ($\times \pi$ rad/sample), which is actually the stopband edge in normalized form. The order of the filter is 5.

\mysubsub{Elliptic approximation}
\begin{verbatim}
    >> lab_5_b
    Enter the filter type: elliptic
    Order of elliptic filter=4
\end{verbatim}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{../Figures/elliptic.eps}
    \caption{Plot for frequency response of elliptic filter}
    \label{fig:5_2_ellip}
\end{figure}
From the observations in Figure~\ref{fig:5_2_ellip}, the nature of the filter is lowpass. There is visible ripple in both the passband and the stopband of the filter. The passband ripple is $\leq0.5$ dB and the stopband attenuation is $\geq40$ dB. The cut-off frequency is 0.30 ($\times \pi$ rad/sample), which is actually the passband edge in normalized form. The order of the filter is 4. 
\mysubsub{Comparison between the filter types}
\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|m{0.3\linewidth}||m{0.2\linewidth}||m{0.2\linewidth}||m{0.1\linewidth}|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Filter Type}&\textbf{Passband}&\textbf{Stopband}&\textbf{Order}\\\hline\hline
        Butterworth&Flat&Flat&9\\\hline
        Chebyshev I&Equiripple&Flat&5\\\hline
        Chebyshev II&Flat&Equiripple&5\\\hline
        Elliptic&Equiripple&Equiripple&4\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}
From the summarized comparison, it is clear that there is a tradeoff between monotonic response and the order of the filter. For the maximally flat butterworth filter, the order is 9, which on contrast is 4 for the elliptic filter which has equiripple in both the passband and the stopband.
\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
In this lab experiment we dealt with the design of IIR filters. Firstly, conversion of analog filters using two methods, viz. impulse invariance method and bilinear transformation was performed. During this, the aliasing effect was noted for impulse invariance method which is why it should not be preferred for designing IIR filter other than lowpass nature. However, for bilinear transformation such effect wasn't seen, so it has no restriction on the type of filter that can be designed. Similarly, the other problem dealt with designing and comparing filter approximation techniques for given IIR digital lowpass specifications. The comparison showed that there is a tradeoff between the monotonic nature and order of filter. \\
Hence, the objectives of the lab experiment were fulfilled.
